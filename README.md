# FaceOutPy
Python (core) module for faceOut

This Software Aims to provide safety to the house of the user of the system.

*In recent years, human detection techniques, especially those implemented by face detection strategies, have been successfully applied to many consumer products such as digital cameras, smart phones, or surveillance systems for detecting people. Adding to these ideas, in era of IoT,when everything is being connected to internet it is vital to implement this technology to enhance the security of doors as well which can be controlled remotely through smartphones and computer.*

Controlling door lock through Face Recognition System will be facilitated with control over Android mobile phone. Because of the usability of the face recognition, this idea and its algorithms can be used in many other areas like defence, aiding differently abled people etc.

The project is divided into two main modules-
1. Central Control module based on Python 2.7.x
2. Android app Used for user interaction.

## Control Module
This module provides the core functionality to the System. This module currently utilises the *Kairos* cloud based Face Recognition API.
